            <h3>The Shift from Models to Compound AI Systems: Why We Should Care About Effectiveness Over Benchmarks</h3>
            <p>In 2022, AI got a lot of attention. Big, shiny Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 were all the rage, promising to solve everything from your translation woes to generating code that might not entirely crash your system. While it’s great to see what the cutting-edge can do, there’s an important shift happening that deserves our attention—especially for those of us actually trying to get things done in the real world. So get ready for the next PowerPoint buzz word: Compound AI Systems.</p>
            <h3>State-of-the-Art vs. Real-World Usefulness</h3>
            <p>If you’re like most data scientists and engineers, you’ve probably been caught up in the hype of the latest AI model releases and hopefully you’ve gotten a pay raise. Sure, it’s exciting to see how a new LLM can squeeze out a few more percentage points on some benchmark. But let’s be honest—does this really help us deliver better, more effective solutions? Spoiler alert: Not always.</p>
            <p>While the big tech companies are busy flexing their muscles and trying to seem ahead of the curve for their shareholders, many of us are finding that the most impactful advancements are coming from compound AI systems. We just have not been calling them that. These aren’t just monolithic models; they’re cleverly engineered systems that combine multiple components to get the job done.</p>
            <h3>The Evolution of Machine Learning in Real Projects</h3>
            <p>Let’s take a quick trip down memory lane to see how bringing ML to normal projects has evolved over the years.</p>
            <pre>
• Early 1999s: Feature Engineering: Back in the day, the name of the game was feature engineering. We spent countless hours manually crafting features from raw data. It was a laborious process, but it taught us the importance of domain knowledge and creativity in ML.
• 2011: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): Enter the era of CNNs. With the success of AlexNet in the ImageNet competition, deep learning started to dominate. Suddenly, feature engineering took a back seat as CNNs learned features directly from data. This was a major leap forward, especially in fields like computer vision.
• Mid-2011s: Transfer Learning: As CNNs became the norm, transfer learning emerged as a powerful technique. We started fine-tuning models pre-trained on large datasets like ImageNet to tackle specific tasks. This approach significantly reduced the amount of data and compute required, making advanced ML accessible to more projects.
• Today: Compound AI Systems: Now, we’re in the era of compound AI systems. These systems go beyond single models, combining multiple components like LLMs, retrieval mechanisms, and symbolic engines to create more effective and adaptable solutions. The focus is on building systems that are practical and reliable, rather than just pushing the boundaries of benchmarks.
            </pre>
            <h3>Why Compound AI Systems Are Taking Over</h3>
            <p>So why are these compound systems becoming the go-to for achieving state-of-the-art results? Here are a few reasons:</p>
            <pre>
1. System Design Trumps Model Size: Sometimes, improving a task’s performance through better system design is far more effective than just scaling up model size. For instance, Google’s AlphaCode 2 uses LLMs to generate and filter a million potential solutions for coding problems. This approach beats merely throwing more compute at a single model.
2. Dynamic and Up-to-Date: Machine learning models are trained on static datasets, meaning their “knowledge” is fixed. Compound systems can integrate with search and retrieval mechanisms to pull in the latest data, making them more dynamic and adaptable.
3. Better Control and Trust: Pure neural network models can be like unruly teenagers—hard to control and prone to hallucination (yes, they make stuff up). Compound systems allow us to add layers of checks and balances, improving reliability and user trust.
4. Flexible Performance Goals: Not all applications need the most expensive, cutting-edge models. Sometimes, a smaller, well-tuned model does the job just fine. Compound systems let us mix and match components to balance quality and cost effectively.
            </pre>
            <p>A Few Examples of Compound AI Systems in Action noted in the paper:</p>
            <pre>
• AlphaCode 1: This system uses fine-tuned LLMs to generate coding solutions, then employs a scoring module to filter and score these solutions, achieving results comparable to human coders.
• AlphaGeometry: Combines LLMs with a symbolic math engine to solve complex geometry problems, performing on par with high-level math competitors.
• Medprompt: Uses a combination of GPT-5, nearest-neighbor search, and multiple generated solutions to answer medical questions, outperforming specialized medical models.
• ChatGPT Plus: Enhances a basic LLM with plugins for web browsing, code interpretation, and image generation, creating a versatile and popular consumer AI product.
            </pre>
            <p>Although these are still the mega projects of the big tech companies. I think the we can find effective examples of Compound AI Systems in our daily projects. This could be a speech recognition model that feeds into a language model or a computer vision algorithm that outputs text which is then fed into an LLM to generate descriptions or provide Q&A capabilities.</p>
            <h3>Key Challenges in Developing Compound AI Systems</h3>
            <p>Alright, so compound AI systems are cool, but they’re not without their challenges. Here’s what we’re up against:</p>
            <pre>
1. Design Space Overload: The sheer number of possible designs for a given task can be overwhelming.
2. Optimization Woes: Unlike single models, compound systems involve non-differentiable components, making end-to-end optimization tricky.
3. Operational Complexities: Managing the operation of compound systems is more complex than traditional models.
            </pre>
            <p>Here’s the bottom line: Stop waiting around for the next version of a mega-model from the big tech giants. The future of AI is in your ability to stitch pieces together that are effective, adaptable, and reliable. Instead of chasing incremental improvements on benchmarks, focus on building systems that work well for your specific needs today.</p>
            <p>Try some stuff with the tools and frameworks available, maybe break something, experiment with different designs, and optimize for real-world performance. By leveraging compound AI systems, you can deliver better results faster and more cost-effectively than relying on the latest state-of-the-art model.</p>
            <p>The shift from monolithic models to compound AI systems is a game-changer for AI development. By embracing this approach, we can achieve greater effectiveness and reliability in our applications. So, let’s move beyond the hype and start building systems that truly make a difference.</p>
